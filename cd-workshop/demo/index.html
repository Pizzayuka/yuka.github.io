  <h1>history of tribal tattoos</h1>
  <p>Tattooing has been a part of human society for thousands and thousands of years, especially in tribal cultures – tribal meaning people who live in family-, clan-, and lineage-based units with social and ideological solidarity, of which there have historically been thousands all around the world, many of which practiced tattooing.</p>

  <p>Whang-od Oggay is the Philippines’ last and oldest “mambabatok” (traditional Kalinga tattooist). “The tradition will continue as long as people keep coming to get tattoos,” she tells CNN Travel.</p>

  <h1>polynesian tattoos</h1>

  <p>Perhaps one of the richest tribal tattoo histories that we know about is that of the Polynesian tradition. A practice with thousands of years in history, Polynesian tattoos can be directly traced as a root of today’s common tattooing practices. Nearly everyone in ancient Polynesia was tattooed.</p>

  <p>Because there was no writing in Polynesian culture, the Polynesians used tattoos for many purposes such as indicating status in the hierarchy, sexual maturity, genealogy, and rank. In Tonga and Samoa, tattooing developed into a refined art form.</p>
    
  <p>The symbolism and placement of Polynesian tattoos had a very specific meaning. Tattoos on the head represented spirituality, knowledge, wisdom, and intuition. Upper body tattoos above the navel symbolized generosity, sincerity, honor, and reconciliation, while the area from the thighs to the navel represented energy, courage, procreation, independence, and sexuality.</p>
    
  <p>
  Thigh tattoos related to strength and marriage, upper arms and shoulders to strength and bravery, lower arms and 
  hands to creativity, creation, and making things. Tattoos on the legs and feet symbolized moving forward, transformation, progress, separation, choice, concreteness, and material matters. Finally, tattoos 
  on the joints represented union, contact, and commitment.

  <h1>tribal tattoos in north america</h1>

  <p>For many years, tattoos were mostly seen on sailors and tradesmen in North America. Although tattooing steadily grew in popularity after the invention of the electric tattoo machine in 1891, it wasn’t until the 1950s and 60s that America saw a Tattoo Renaissance during which tattoos became much more mainstream.</p>

  <p>The tradition of tribal tattooing in North America as we know it today was in large part due to an effort by tattoo artists Don Ed Hardy and Leo Zulueta in the 1970s. Hardy’s magazine, Tattoo Times, had a strong focus on tribal tattoos, helping to popularize them. Being of Hawaiian and Filpino descent, Zulueta collected as many photos and drawings of native tattoos as he could, hoping to encourage Native Hawaiians to embrace indigenous tattoo traditions again. Together, Hardy and Zulueta tattooed many people, specifically with tribal tattoos as their main focus.

  <p>Zulueta comes from the class of tattoo artists who began their careers just as the punk rock movement was being ushered in. When he began his work, Zulueta’s client base wasn’t filled with middle class college students and creative professionals donning the markings of the Creative Class. It was filled with punk rock artists and counter-culture troublemakers.Today, as tattooing becomes only more and more popular and normalized, the diversity of styles is tremendous. However, tribal tattoos remain a staple of the tattooing world, sometimes divorced from their ritualistic and sacred roots, though often still with respect to and knowledge of them.

<h1>the 90s tribal tattoos</h1>

  <p>When people hear the words ‘tribal tattoos’ today, their first thought is usually of the black sort of sharp and pointy mid-to-late 90s style of, among others, Wesley Snipes’ vampire superhero Blade. </p>

  <p>Angelina back in the day had only 
    these couple of small tribal designs on her lower back. Now they are incorporated 
    into a bigger piece including a hand poked tiger tattoo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tribal tattoos can also look good on the face! The infamous Mike Tyson face tattoo has made him both a mockery and a complete hit with tattoo fans and artists alike. Copied in the film “The Hangover” 
    it might just be the most famous tribal tattoo ever.

<h1>neotribal</h1>

  <p>Tribal tattoo artists today work mostly with black in abstract shapes, made up of dots and lines. Often, entire areas of the body will be blacked out.
  </p>
  <p>
    A style has evolved often referred to as neo-tribal, where artists are inspired by the deep roots of the body art tradition but often with a more contemporary feel. Tattooists across the globe are merging their own individual style with ancient, tribal symbolism, creating pieces that are rich in heritage and meaning. They can often be incredibly aesthetically pleasing.

<h1>the future of tribal tattoos</h1>
  <p>As we become more conscious of issues such as cultural appropriation and the value of reviving and honoring traditional cultures, it’s likely that tribal tattooing will be more and more connected to its roots. Tattoo artists will learn and even be expected to know about the history and meaning of the tribal tattoos they are creating. People will seek out artists who have heritage from the cultures whose tattoos they are creating, and interest in using traditional tribal tattooing methods with tools like the tattooing comb or au will rise.
  </p>

  <p>According to UK-based tattoo artist Hanumantra, whose work is inspired by his travels to Australia and Polynesia, there is also an interest in going beyond mimicking tribal art to trying to tattoo the tribes of the future. Though this can be interpreted to mean many different things, the core idea seems to be an interest in the advancement and progression of 
    tribal tattoos that take inspiration from ancient practices but seek to innovate, move forward, and create a hybrid style 
    of its own.
  </p>

  <p>Finally, as part of the natural development of tattooing, in which styles are reimagined, mixed, and combined, it’s fair to imagine that part of the future of tribal tattoos may be a combination with other tattooing styles.

      <h1>tattooing’s biggest trend is spooky, sensual cybersigilism</h1>
      <p>Currently, a design category defined by long, spearlike lines, symmetrical, tribal-like patterns and cyberpunk precision is flooding the social media feeds of permanent ink enthusiasts. Some of these tattoos look like armor, or veins, or a lattice of tributaries flowing into a river. The effect is simultaneously alien, 
        natural and futuristic. It’s also undeniably hard to describe.
      </p>
      <p class="quotes" id="fuck">“Someone please name that popular style of tattooing that everyone does now which has all the ornate, medieval, spiky, fine-line detailing and unconnected lines.” –Jackson Johnson
      </p>
      <p>Noel Garcia, a Brooklyn-based tattoo artist who goes by wr4th.co on Instagram, calls the style Cybersigilism; sigil, a word derived from Latin, refers to a sign 
        or symbol thought to hold occult or magical power.</p>

  <p>With the revival of 2000s trends like tiny Y2K sunglasses, baguette bags and cargo pants currently raging, it stands to reason that tattoos, too, are reflecting the flavors of a not-so-bygone era, filtered through a contemporary and distinctly dystopian lens.</p>

    <p>Traditional American tattoos tend to be characterized by thick lines of ink, bright colors and a narrow series of imagistic reference points (ships, maidens, “I Love Mom”) but abstracted Cybersigilist designs, Garcia said, are harder to pin down.</p>
    
    <p>“People always want a strong meaning behind their tattoos, and I think with these tattoos, you usually find the meaning after getting them tattooed,” Garcia said. “They just become a part of the person’s body, and that person becomes their own video game character or fashion character or warrior, or whatever you want to call it. They almost act like jewelry adornments that flow with the body.”</p>
    
    <p>Ernesto Ramirez, a Mexico City-based tattoo artist fluent in Cybersigilist designs who goes by @neto_rabia on Instagram, told The Daily Beast that he’d seen requests for the style really start to pick up in the last six months.</p>
        
    <p>“One of the things I want to do is spread this kind of feeling—I don’t know if in my fantasy it’s like a disease or a kind of poison,” Ramirez said. “In the way that I do it, I try to feel something like horror or a dark side, and I want to make the world turn into more of this kind of feeling.”</p>
    
    <p>“Most popular things are very soft, like the movies,” Ramirez said. “I feel that popular movies are very naive, and I want to introduce more violence, or something hard.”

  <p>Artist Aingel, whose Instagram handle is @cybersigilism, has been tattooing for the last six years and splits her time between Atlanta and New York. “After about three years of really trying to push this style, I started to do some bigger pieces and haven’t really turned back since,” she told The Daily Beast.</p>

    <p>“For me, the sigils kind of started as something that just helped me get through a really dark time, and at first I really wasn’t able to tattoo them,” Aingel said. “It was more of a side thing and they were just for me and helped me feel better. After a while, I started being able to offer that to other people. At the end of the day, as long as the people that I’m giving tattoos are walking out happy and feeling good about their body, that’s the most important meaning.”</p>
    
   <p> People often dedicate tattoos to outside influences—loved ones or songs or works of art that carry deep significance. Cybersigilism, with its exaggerated, techno-biological grace, feels more like a radical acceptance of the sensual, wordless, often-dark, extremely 
    complex self.
